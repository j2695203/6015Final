# 6015Final
6015 final Qt team project

<b>Objective</b>

Building a gaming framework and using software skills while working in a team. Every player can have an account through which they can access their profiles and game(s) at the last reached level, and can check the performance and the history scores in every game. We will consider two sprints for this software application. It is up to you to decide on the time frame of each sprint.
